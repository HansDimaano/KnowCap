                Users can display the contents of their computer screen on a video stream, website, or document, 
                by using a clipping technique called screen capture. Screen capture is a fantastic tool if you want to 
                take a picture or video of your computer desktop and store it as a file on your computer.

         TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF REVEAL ANIMATION:
 
         - The reveal animation works through the Reveal Animation CSS and JavaScript.
         - I highly recommend you to open those two files to know how it works.
 
         - I assign which elements will have reveal animation by assigning "reveal ___" in its class names.
         - The blank in "reveal ___" is for the direction of the animation. It could be either up, right, left, or down.
         - You can search "with Reveal Animation" to show which elements has Reveal Animation.
