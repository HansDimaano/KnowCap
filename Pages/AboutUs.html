            <p>
                KnowCap offers its users a promising experience when it comes to capturing media with their computers. 
                Currently, KnowCap has 3 different modes for capturing. First is Video Capture, which allows users to capture 
                video of themselves with the use of their device's camera. The second is Audio Capture, which allows users to do 
                their voice recordings without any hassle. Lastly, Screen capture is best for capturing the best moments on your 
                screen, whether it's gaming or recreational activities.

                KnowCap is created by Hans Christian M. Dimaano.  He is a talented individual who is very passionate & committed 
                to his projects. His main goal is to help students or developers like him be familiar with APIs, specifically Video, 
                Audio, and Screen Capture APIs. KnowCap all started when he found frustration in finding a promising online capturing 
                tool. That's why he started developing KnowCap, which took him approximately two weeks.

        TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF WEB ANIMATION:

        - Selected elements that has animation only at the start of the page are animated through the Web Animations API JavaScript.
        - The elements are selected by setting their IDs such as revealLeftOnce or revealRightOnce.

        - The scroll reveal animation works through the Reveal Animation CSS and Reveal Content Function in the same JavaScript.
        - I highly recommend you to open those two files to know how it works.

        - I assign which elements will have scroll reveal animation by assigning "reveal ___" in its class names.
        - The blank in "reveal ___" is for the direction of the animation. It could be either up, right, left, or down.
